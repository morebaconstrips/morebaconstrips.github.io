My name is Gabriele and I&rsquo;m an MSc cybersecurity student. My objective is to make the internet a safer place for everyone by combining my special set of abilities with an insatiable curiosity.</h4>
<p>I hold a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Linguistics and one in Computer Science, a combination that may seem unexpected, but it perfectly represents my multifaceted approach to problem-solving and my commitment to understanding the cybersecurity from different points of view.</p>
<p>I am always drawn towards offensive technologies because they present puzzles waiting to be solved. I see hacking as a kind of strategic game in which intellect and lateral thinking are the main characters. It involves continuously testing your intelligence and talent by overtaking the opponent on the other end of the Internet.</p>
<p>My areas of expertise include web security, Internet of Things security, and biometric systems. I have spent the last years in understanding their strengths, vulnerabilities, and their potential improvements.</p>
<p>However, what truly sets me apart is my love for learning. I constantly keep myself informed about the recent discoveries and news about this topic.</p>
<p>Hey, I almost forgot to mention that besides all the cybersecurity and nerdy stuff I&rsquo;m into, I absolutely love spending time outdoors. I&rsquo;m really passionate about sports, going on mountain hikes and exploring new places (and local food) when I travel. These experiences not only fuel my creativity but also help me find balance in life. They remind me of all the incredible beauty that exists beyond the digital world.</p>
<p>So, whether you&rsquo;re a fellow cybersecurity enthusiast, a potential collaborator, or someone seeking to reinforce your organization&rsquo;s defenses, I&rsquo;m here, ready to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-abbate/">connect</a>, learn, and contribute!</p>
