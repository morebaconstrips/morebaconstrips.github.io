      <description>Mar 2023 - Jun 2023
For an innovation and entrepreneurship university course, my team and I embarked on a journey to conceptualize, design, and develop a revolutionary product known as PaprikÃ . This innovative device, shaped like a paprika, seamlessly blends the realms of technology, business acumen, and practicality. Our project&amp;rsquo;s focus was divided equally between innovation and business aspects, and the technical competencies required to bring our idea to life, from 3D printing the device to creating a robust platform with integrated APIs.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Examples Evading deepfake-image detectors with white-box attacks</title>

      <description>Jan 2023 - Aug 2023
The project involved conducting in-depth research into potential white and black box attacks on a ResNet50, aiming to significantly reduce the classifier&amp;rsquo;s accuracy to near 0%. Subsequently, white-box attacks were implemented on a ResNet50 model fine-tuned with the TrueFace dataset provided by the University of Trento. The results were remarkable, as we successfully lowered the Neural Network&amp;rsquo;s accuracy from 100% to nearly 0%.</description>

      <description>Jul 2023 - Aug 2023
Our team played a pivotal role in advancing Thera (a Lithuanian mental health app) by integrating AI-driven safety measures. By implementing a carefully designed decision-tree logic and dynamic AI filtering, we ensured that user interactions with the app were guided towards safer outcomes. Our contribution significantly bolstered Thera&amp;rsquo;s commitment to user well-being, offering enhanced support and tailored responses while mitigating potential risks, thereby fostering a safer and more effective mental health journey for every user.</description>

      <description>I found this nice website that is supposed to help me get better at flag capturing, however, it just tells me to GIT GUD!
gobuster -u http://ths.eemcs.utwente.nl:33035/ -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt We discover that the .git dir is exposed
wget -m http://ths.eemcs.utwente.nl:33035/.git/ git ls-files --stage Scraping in the folders we notice the sha1 of a git object in a file called master, so we read the content

      <description>While exploring an old ruin in the Middle East, you appear to have found a magic lamp! To your disappointment, only a binary file and a URL to a remote server came out after rubbing it. If you can convince the remote genie you know its password, maybe it will give you a flag.
After spinning up the docker container, you can connect to it using netcat, by executing $ netcat [ip] [port]</description>

      <description> The byte size of 8 bits was chosen because it is a power of 2, other than that, it is an arbitrary length. Instead, we think that the 9-bit byte, i.e. the nyte is much cooler! The string below is a hexadecimal encoding of our flag represented as ASCII in nytes, can you retrieve the flag?

      <description>Everyone knows the best part of browsing the internet is the delicious cookies you get from every website you visit. Therefore we have created a special website just for you to get a lot of new cookies. Can you collect all of them before they turn stale? Start the website by clicking the &amp;lsquo;Start Docker container&amp;rsquo; button below!
Seems like we need to be faster in order not to let the cookie go bad</description>

      <description>While going through some books, Alice found the identity of the whistleblower in their company and was utterly suprised by the name. She needed to inform Eve about it but she didn&amp;rsquo;t know who is watching her emails. So she decided to hide the message in her email to Eve. See if you can figure out who betrayed the company.

Dear Eve, Thank you for your email informing me of your absence.</description>

      <description>Feb 2022 - Jul 2022
Project about biometric encryption for my bachelor thesis. I have developed an efficient algorithm for fingerprint recognition and matching. This algorithm served as the foundation of my research, which entails the implementation of a fast and highly secure algorithm of encryption and decryption using Shamir&amp;rsquo;s Secret Sharing scheme.
Image Processing The first part of the algorithm provides a sequence of operations aimed at making the input image as clear and legible as possible, in order to facilitate the minutiae extraction process.</description>
