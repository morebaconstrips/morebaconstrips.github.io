<p>The project involved conducting in-depth research based on Carlini and Farid&rsquo;s <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w39/Carlini_Evading_Deepfake-Image_Detectors_With_White-_and_Black-Box_Attacks_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf">paper</a> into potential white and black box attacks on ResNet50, aiming to significantly reduce the classifier&rsquo;s accuracy to near 0%. Subsequently, one of the proposed white-box attacks (a Loss-Maximizing-like attack) was implemented to attack the ResNet50 model fine-tuned with the TrueFace dataset provided by the University of Trento.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the project was to enable ResNet50 to misclassify all the fake images extracted from the database and to make it falsely identify these images as real. This ambitious objective aimed to demonstrate the susceptibility of the classifier to adversarial attacks, highlight potential vulnerabilities in image recognition systems, and propose some ways to prevent these attacks to happen.</p>
<p>The results were remarkable, as we successfully lowered the neural network&rsquo;s accuracy from 100% to 0%, even with small perturbations, as can be seen in the plots below.</p>

<p>N.B. Due to safety and ethical considerations, the code developed for this project has not been published. This decision was made to prevent any unintended or malicious use of the attack strategy and to mitigate the potential risks associated with deploying such techniques in real-world scenarios</p>
