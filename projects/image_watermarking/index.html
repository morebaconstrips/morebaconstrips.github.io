<p>The Robust Image Watermarking is a technique based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_wavelet_transform">DWT</a>) and All Phase Discrete Cosine Biorthogonal Transform (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-023-16106-1">APDCBT</a>), implemented for the &ldquo;Multimedia Data Security&rdquo; project.</p>
<p>To read the paper on which this implementation was based, go <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/10/3/77">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since this project was destined for a final exam, in which we had to implement the most resilient watermarking technique while attacking the others, I also worked on a couple of scripts that implement attacks used with the end goal of ruining the other teams&rsquo; watermarks without compromising the Weighted Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8803307">WPSNR</a>).</p>
<p>The implemented method is divided into two phases: insertion and extraction.</p>
<p>The insertion phase is divided into 7 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A one-level DWT decomposition with “Haar” wavelet is first performed on the carrier image, yielding four sub-bands: three high-frequency sub-bands (LH, HL, and HH) and a low-frequency sub-band (LL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We apply DWT decomposition again on the low-frequency sub-band, yielding four sub-bands: three high-frequency sub-bands (LH2, HL2, and HH2) and a low-frequency sub-band (LL2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reduce the influence of watermark insertion, two high-frequency sub-bands, LH2 and HL2, are selected for the insertion of two identical watermarks. Using the HL2 sub-band as an example, the block-based APDCBT is applied to each sub-block obtained by dividing the image into 8x8 blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DC coefficient of each sub-block is used to generate a new coefficient matrix, denoted by <code>M</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first watermark, <code>W1</code>, is inserted into the coefficient matrix, as shown below:<br>
<code>SW = S + alpha*W1, SW = U_W * S_W1*V^T_W</code></p>
<p>Where <code>alpha</code> is the watermark embedding intensity, <code>SW</code> is a matrix containing the watermark information, <code>U_W</code> and <code>V_W</code> are newly generated orthogonal matrices, and <code>S_W1</code> is the modified singular value matrix after watermark insertion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the second watermark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, we apply the InverseAPDCBT and twice the InverseDWT to obtain the Watermarked image.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The extraction phase is divided into 6 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We divide the original image using DWT decomposition twice.</li>
<li>We apply the APDCBT transformation on the HL2 to obtain 1024 highest coefficients divided into 4x4 of the horizontal wavelet (HORIZ).</li>
<li>We apply the APDCBT transformation on the LH2 to obtain 1024 highest coefficients divided into 4x4 of the vertical wavelet (VERTIC).</li>
<li>Apply the same steps on the watermarked image to obtain HORIZ_w and VERTIC_w.</li>
<li>Now calculate W1 and W2, calculated respectively as (VERTIC_w-VERTIC)/alpha and (HORIZ_w-HORIZ)/alpha.</li>
<li>Retrieve the watermark W, which is calculated as<br>
<code>W = (W1+W2)/2</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the attacks, we implemented the classic attacks (i.e., Blur, Median filtering, JPEG compression, etc.) and the most effective combination of them (i.e., Blur + Median, Blur + Median + JPEG, AWGN + Median, Resize + JPEG, etc.). We also implemented localized attacks after dividing the target&rsquo;s watermarked image into n parts.</p>
