<p>For an innovation and entrepreneurship university course, my team and I embarked on a journey to conceptualize, design, and develop a revolutionary product known as Paprikà. This innovative device, shaped like a paprika, seamlessly blends the realms of technology, business acumen, and practicality. Our project&rsquo;s focus was divided equally between innovation and business aspects, and the technical competencies required to bring our idea to life, from 3D printing the device to creating a robust platform with integrated APIs.</p>
<h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>
<p>Paprikà is a time tracking device designed to simplify the lives of those who seek to gain better control over their work hours. Shaped like a paprika, it brings a touch of whimsy to the often mundane task of time tracking. However, behind its playful exterior lies a robust set of features designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing time.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduction of Cognitive Load: Paprikà adopts a minimalist approach to time tracking. Each side of the device represents a distinct task, eliminating the need for complex data entry. The accompanying display app aggregates statistics, offering users a quick and intuitive overview of their time allocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoice Generation: Paprikà allows users to generate invoices effortlessly. By grouping tasks into projects and assigning hourly rates, users can quickly create invoices and even send them through the Italian &ldquo;Sistema di Interscambio.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project Management: The device assists users in organizing their work efficiently by grouping tasks into projects. This feature ensures that projects are tracked accurately and comprehensively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live Reports: Paprikà empowers users to generate and share live reports. By selecting specific activities and exporting them in PDF format, users can easily communicate their progress to clients or team members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-technical-build">The technical build</h2>
<p>Paprikà incorporates an array of components and technologies that bring it to life. The technical implementation was a critical part of our project, and we meticulously selected the following components to ensure the device&rsquo;s functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LCD1602a Display: The LCD display provides a clear interface for users to view and interact with their tracked tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accelerometer and Gyro MPU6050 6-DoF: This component is crucial for tracking movements and durations accurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breadboard and Potentiometer: These components enable the seamless integration of sensors and controls within the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ESP8266 Microprocessor: The brains behind Paprikà, this microprocessor handles data processing and communication with the platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<img alt="display" src="/images/gyro.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="the-design-process">The Design Process</h2>
<p>To bring the Paprikà device to life, we utilized Autodesk Fusion 360 for the design process. This powerful design software allowed us to craft the distinct paprika shape and ensure that the device was recognizable when printed on our 3D printer.</p>
<p>Printing the device was a significant step in the project. We utilized an FLSUN 3D printer to create the physical embodiment of Paprikà. The result was a sleek and visually appealing device that perfectly captured our vision.

<img alt="display" src="/images/case.jpeg"></p>
<h2 id="the-software-ecosystem">The Software Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Paprikà&rsquo;s software ecosystem was implemented with the following technologies, with a strong emphasis on robustness and user-friendliness.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MongoDB Database: To store and manage all user data securely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST API and Go Server: Handling the server-side operations, ensuring smooth communication between the device and the platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React.js and TypeScript: These technologies were employed for the frontend development, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vite: Used for fast and efficient development and building of the frontend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
