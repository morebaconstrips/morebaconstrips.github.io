<p>The project was developed by my team, made of five students from different European universities, during our Summer School organized by EIT Digital Master School.</p>
<p>Our team played a pivotal role in advancing Thera (a Lithuanian mental health app) by integrating AI-driven safety measures. By implementing a carefully designed decision-tree logic and dynamic AI filtering, we ensured that user interactions with the app were guided towards safer outcomes. Our contribution significantly bolstered Thera&rsquo;s commitment to user well-being, offering enhanced support and tailored responses while mitigating potential risks, thereby fostering a safer and more effective mental health journey for every user.</p>

Fig. 2: The decision tree: Life Threatening (LT) is a variable representing the level of physical danger a user could face based on their input. Mental Health Disorder (MHD) is a boolean variable representing the possibility that an input is related to a mental health disorder. Each leaf of the tree represents the answer given by the application</p>
<p><img src="/images/thera/solution.png" alt="display">
Fig. 3: The proposed solution in case of immediate life-threatening emergency (LT &gt; 60)</p>
<p>The solution proposed by our team is innovative in many regards. First it allows some control over GPT by allowing it to prompt safer answers. By controlling the AI two times, one right after the input, one right before the output, we ensure a better risk limitation, and after testing our solution and comparing it to GPT’s answer we realised that our solution catches more risks and proposes more appropriate responses than GPT’s native filters. In addition, Thera is a pioneer in their field, as they are setting a standard for safer usage of AI for mental health. Finally, as the solution proposed is limiting the risk of harming users, we prevent Thera from being in difficult legal situations while providing them with good arguments in case of anything happening to one of their users after using their application.</p>
