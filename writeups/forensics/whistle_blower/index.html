Thank you for your email informing me of your absence. I hope you feel better soon. Do not worry about your presentation with the Stegno Space Ltd. I can cover for you. Could you please send me your notes for that.

Thank you,

</code></pre><p>So I mapped every tab and space in 1s and 0s and decoded them from binary with space as delimiter and 7 as byte length. here’s what I got:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>input: 1100010 1011111 0110001 1110011 1011111 0110001 1001000 0110011 1011111 1110111 0110001 1110011 0110111 1001100 0110011 1011111 1000010 1101100 0110000 1110111 0110011 1110010 1111101
output: b_1s_1H3_w1s7L3_Bl0w3r}
</code></pre><p>It looks like a piece of flag!</p>
<p>I did the same mapping with the tabs and spaces at the end of each line from the beginning, although I had to change the byte length to 8.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>input: 00000001 01010100 01001000 01010011 01111011 01000010 00110000
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>output: THS{B0
</code></pre><p>Then I retrieved the flag by simply concatenating the strings</p>
